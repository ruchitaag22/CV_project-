# CV_Workshop
Welcome to the official repository for the OpenCV Workshop. This repo contains all the demo scripts, examples, and code used during the hands-on sessions of the workshop, aimed at helping beginners get started with Computer Vision using Python and OpenCV.
👁️‍🗨️ OpenCV Workshop – Hands-On Computer Vision with Python.

📚 Workshop Overview:- 

In this workshop, participants will learn how to:
Capture and display live webcam video using OpenCV convert video streams to grayscale apply basic image processing filters (blur, edge detection, etc.) perform face detection using Haar cascade classifiers track objects based on color in real-time preprocess images for downstream CV tasks.

Whether you're new to Computer Vision or looking to reinforce your foundational skills, this workshop will help you build practical experience through code and experimentation.
